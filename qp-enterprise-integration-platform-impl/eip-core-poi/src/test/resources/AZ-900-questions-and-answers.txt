Allow gateway transit: Check this box if you have a virtual network gateway attached to this virtual network and want to allow traffic from the peered virtual network to flow through the gateway. For example, this virtual network may be attached to an on-premises network through a virtual network gateway. The gateway can be an ExpressRoute or VPN gateway. Checking this box allows traffic from the peered virtual network to flow through the gateway attached to this virtual network to the on-premises network. If you check this box, the peered virtual network cannot have a gateway configured. The peered virtual network must have the Use remote gateways checkbox checked when setting up the peering from the other virtual network to this virtual network. If you leave this box unchecked (default), traffic from the peered virtual network still flows to this virtual network, but cannot flow through a virtual network gateway attached to this virtual network. If the peering is between a virtual network (Resource Manager) and a virtual network (classic), the gateway must be in the virtual network (Resource Manager).

E. The subnets on VNet3 only. All Azure resources are created in an Azure region and subscription. A resource can only be created in a virtual network that exists in the same region and subscription as the resource. You can however, connect virtual networks that exist in different subscriptions and regions. For more information, see connectivity. When deciding which region(s) to deploy resources in, consider where consumers of the resources are physically located. Consumers of resources typically want the lowest network latency to their resources. To determine relative latencies between a specified location and Azure regions, see View relative latencies. Do you have data residency, sovereignty, compliance, or resiliency requirements? If so, choosing the region that aligns to the requirements is critical. Do you require resiliency across Azure Availability Zones within the same Azure region for the resources you deploy? You can deploy resources, such as virtual machines (VM) to different availability zones within the same virtual network. Not all Azure regions support availability zones however.

B. VNet2 only.
C. VNet3 and VNet4 only.
D. VNet2, VNet3, and VNet4.

#
D. VNet2, VNet3, and VNet4. You can connect virtual networks to each other with virtual network peering. These virtual networks can be in the same region or different regions (also known as Global VNet peering). Once virtual networks are peered, resources in both virtual networks are able to communicate with each other, with the same latency and bandwidth as if the resources were in the same virtual network.
###
Question 256: You have an Azure subscription that contains a policy-based virtual network gateway named GW1 and a virtual network named VNet1.
You need to ensure that you can configure a point-to-site connection from VNet1 to an on-premises computer.
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

A. Reset GW1.
B. Create a route-based virtual network gateway.
C. Delete GW1.
D. Add a public IP address space to VNet1.
E. Add a connection to GW1.
F. Add a service endpoint to VNet1.

#
B. Create a route-based virtual network gateway.
C. Delete GW1.
A VPN gateway is used when creating a VPN connection to your on-premises network. Route-based VPN devices use any-to-any (wildcard) traffic selectors, and let routing/forwarding tables direct traffic to different IPsec tunnels. It is typically built on router platforms where each IPsec tunnel is modeled as a network interface or VTI (virtual tunnel interface). Policy-based VPN devices use the combinations of prefixes from both networks to define how traffic is encrypted/decrypted through IPsec tunnels. It is typically built on firewall devices that perform packet filtering. IPsec tunnel encryption and decryption are added to the packet filtering and processing engine. Point-to-Site connections do not require a VPN device or a public-facing IP address.
###
