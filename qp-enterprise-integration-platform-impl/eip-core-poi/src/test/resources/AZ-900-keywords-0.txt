High Availability
#
Agreed level of uptime. If a server goes down, we have another to go to. Read in a %. Specified in an SLA. Achieved using redundancy. Availability zones and availability certifications.
###
Scalability
#
Scaling up: More CPU cores, memory, or disks
Scaling out: More servers
###
Elasticity
#
Elastic computing is the ability to quickly expand or decrease computer processing, memory, and storage resources to meet changing demands without worrying about capacity planning and engineering for peak usage. Automatic.
Can see this in action in App Service automatic traffic manager
###
Agility
#
Engineering resource availability. Provisioning new resources is fast.
Business response to changing conditions or opportunity is easy in Azure.
How fast Azure can allocated or deallocate resources
###
Fault Tolerance
#
Continue providing service to underlying application even after the failure of one or more components in any layer.
###

###
Economies of Scale for Azure
#
Amazon, Microsoft, Google, are not buying the most robust enterprise grade disks, storage controllers, server chassis, etc.
Cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to scale of operation.
###
Differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
#
Capital Expenditure is an expense a business incurs to create a benefit in the future. Upfront payment. Accounted for over useful life. Ex: buying new server hardware and software for data center.
Operational Expenditure is an expense required for the day to day. Monthly or yearly payment. Accounted for in current month or year. An operating cost. Ex: IaaS offering from Azure
###
What is the consumption-based model?
#
Pay for what you use. Function apps and logic apps have a consumption based plan.
###
Describe IaaS
#
Azure VMs. You manage Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S :: Azure manages Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking
###
Describe PaaS
#
Azure cloud services, Azure App services. You manage Applications and Data :: Azure manages Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking
###
Describe SaaS
#
Azure Websites. Azure manages Application, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking.
###
Public Cloud
#
Most common way of cloud computing. Cloud resources such as storage, and server are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider (Azure). All hardware, software and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. Lower costs, no maintenance, near-unlimited scalability, high reliability
Benefits: No CapEx, Agility, Consumption-based.
###
Private Cloud
#
Computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. The private cloud can be physically located at an on-site datacenter, or hosted by a third-party service provider. All hardware and software are dedicated solely to the organization - governments and banks use this a lot. More flexibility, improved security, high scalability.
Benefits: Control, Security
###
Hybrid Cloud
#
Data can move between private and public cloud greater flexibility and more deployment options. Use public cloud for high-volume, lower security needs such as web-based email, and the private cloud for sensitive, business-critical operations like financial reporting. In hybrid cloud, "cloud bursting" is also an option: when an application or resource runs in the private cloud until there is a spike in demand, such as seasonal event or tax filing, can then burst into the public cloud for additional computing resources. Gives control, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and ease of transferring workloads gradually.
Benefits: Flexibility, Compliance
###
Regions
#
A set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.

###
Azure Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
#
Describe a Service Level Agreement (SLA)
Specific terms that defines the standards of performance
Determine SLA for a particular Azure product or service
Each one is different, all are available on website
3 characteristics of SLAs for Azure products and Services
Performance targets, uptime and connectivity guarantees such as availability
Performance target ranges 99.9 to 99.99
Service credits: percentage of the applicable monthly service fees credited to you if service fails to meet SLA uptime guarantee
Composite SLAs
App Service Web App (99.95) with SQL Database (99.99)
Composite is them multiplied (99.95 x 99.99 = 99.94)
This is lower than individual SLA value
Improving application SLAs
Create their own SLAs aka application SLA
Considerations:
Self-diagnosing and self-healing
Response Time: Responding to failures quickly enough to meet SLA performance target about 99.99 are hard to meet
Realistically achievable: the smaller the time window for recovery, the tighter the tolerance and higher the cost.
###
